** 2019-07-20

This update brings the package (mostly) in line with version
[[https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template/releases/tag/v0.7.0][0.7.0]]
of upstream.

*** Known Issues

- No interface provided for the new attack or spell commands
- Map section formatting will probably break when not used as 3rd and 4th level
  headings. See [[file:README.org::*Map sections][Map sections]]
- =org-dnd-use-package= must be set before =ox-dnd= is loaded

*** Breaking Changes

- Italics are no longer added to quoteboxes automatically.

*** Deprecated

- The =:speed= key in a monster attribute is intended for only ground speed. Use
  one of the specialised keys =:fly=, =:burrow=, =:climb=, =:swim=, or =:hover=
  for other movement speeds
- Setting the heading level, title, etc. options manually is no longer required
  (i.e., can remove =#+OPTIONS: H:5 title:nil toc:nil= unless desired)

*** Bug Fixes

- generate captions below objects ([[https://github.com/xeals/emacs-org-dnd/commit/4184b14504b1950a1c2cd71d011d772a56fb5c71][4184b145]])
