   - =NAME= :: Title of box

** Subtitle

   No attributes.

   Heading on first line of block, subtitle on second line of block.

** Spell

   - =NAME= :: Name of spell
   - =ATTR_SPELL= :: Spell information:
                     - =:level= :: Spell level
                     - =:school= :: Spell school (illusion, abjuration, etc.)
                     - =:range= :: Spell range (include unit; e.g., =5 feet=)
                     - =:cast= :: Cast time (include unit; e.g., =1 action=)
                     - =:duration= :: Spell duration (include unit; e.g., =Until dispelled=,
                                      =1 round/level=)
                     - =:comp= :: Spell components (in full, including information for
                                  material components)

   Block contents are the spell description.

        - =:race=
        - =:subrace=; optional
        - =:alignment=
   - =ATTR_MONSTER_BASICS= :: Basic stat block; all optional:
        - =:ac= (armor class)
        - =:hp= (hit dice; given as dice notation, e.g., 3d8+3)

        automatically; all optional:

        - =:langs= (languages)
        - =:cr= (challenge rating; experience value calculated automatically)


   Block contents are the monster skills in the following format:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     - Skill name :: Effect
     - Actions
       - Action name :: Effect
     - Legendary Actions
       - Legendary action name :: Effect
   #+END_SRC

   Any entry that appears before the actions header is a passive skill. The blurb
   for legendary actions is added automatically. Any number of entries in each
   category (skill, action, legendary action) can be added.
